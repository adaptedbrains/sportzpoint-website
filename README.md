This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev

# Using pnpm
pnpm dev

# Using Node.js runtime
bun dev

# Using Bun runtime (recommended for better performance)
bun run dev:bun
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Runtime Options

This project supports both Node.js and Bun runtimes. Here are the available commands:

### Node.js Runtime (Default)
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run linting
```

### Bun Runtime
```bash
bun run dev:bun    # Start development server with Bun
bun run build:bun  # Build for production with Bun
bun run start:bun  # Start production server with Bun
bun run lint:bun   # Run linting with Bun
```

Using Bun runtime can provide better performance and faster installation times. To install dependencies with Bun:
```bash
bun install
```
